# Grid
> Bootstrap Grid System

Grid is module that contains Bootstraps Grid System. I created this because I
didn't want to include all of Bootstrap in my application when I was only using
the grid and making the rest of the components on my own. All of the code in this
repo is from [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass).

## Usage

`npm install --save gridsystem`
